### <font color='indianred'>overview</font> {#sec-overview}

While not being the most prototypical Sanskrit word for the concept of 'sound' (that being probably *śabda*), at its core, *ghoṣa* means just that: `sound`. Within this broad sense, its semantic spectrum spans three main areas, `vocal sound`, inanimate sound and, by extension, `mosquitoes` and `cowsheds`, i.e. distinctly noisy things. Vocal sounds include `proclamations`, but even in this sense *ghoṣa* highlights the auditory dimension of such proclamations, rather than the verbal content of them (cf *abhidharmakośabhāṣya* 080.26.080.28)[^ghosa-1]. In sūtras and narrative texts, *ghosa* is often deployed in this sense in descriptions of powerful characters (e.g. a buddha or a king), where it characterizes their voice as resounding and awe-inspiring, like a thunders and roars (*buddhacarita* 5.24; *dharmasaṃgraha* 335)[^ghosa-2]. For this reason, *ghoṣa* is often included in lists of a great beings' qualities (*daśabhūmikasūtra* 24)[^ghosa-3]. In the more general sense of non-verbal sound, *ghoṣa* often refers to sounds that elicit emotional responses, be it pleasant melodies (*lalitavistara* 113)[^ghosa-4] or the intimidating rumble of thunders (*mahāyānasūtrālaṃkāra* 80).

[^ghosa-1]: *vāṅ-nāmni pravarttate nām\^ārthaṃ dyotayati n\^aiva ghoṣa-mātraṃ vāg yena tu **ghoṣ**eṇ\^ārthaḥ pratīyate sa ghoṣo vāk /* \[*abhidharmakośabhāṣya,* 080.26.080.28\]\
    "What I call ‘voice’ is not merely vocal sound, but a vocal sound that causes one to attain to an object, that is, a vocal sound with regard to which persons who are speaking are in agreement as to what a certain thing signifies." \[Pruden 251\]

[^ghosa-2]: atha ghoṣam imaṃ mah\^ābhra-**ghoṣ**aḥ pariśuśrāva śamaṃ paraṃ ca lebhe śrutavān sa hi nirvṛt\^eti śabdaṃ parinirvāṇa-vidhau matiṃ cakāra // 5 — 25 // *buddhacarita* 5.24\
    "Then, as he heard this voice, he obtained supreme calm, he whose voice was like that of a great thunder cloud; for, as he heard the word “fulfilled,” he set his mind on the means to final Nirvanic fulfillment." \[Olivelle 133\] ; *aśīty-anuvyañjanāni / tadyathā \[…\] megha-garjita-**ghoṣatā** / madhura-cāru-mañju-svaratā* / *dharmasaṃgraha* 335\
    "There are eighty secondary characteristics, they are: \[…\] a voice that sounds like thunder, a voice that is sweet, charming and lovely, \[…\]." \[Bhikkhu 66\]

    "Inside this beautiful palace, the Bodhisattva woke up to the sound of conches, kettledrums, clay drums, wood drums, lutes, harps, tambourines, cymbals, and flutes that produced the most sweet-sounding and melodious tunes to accompany their many sweet songs.

### <font color='indianred'>context</font> {#sec-context}

Ghoṣa enters several collocations that shed light on its nuanced semantic spectrum ranging from a pleasant musical sound to a resounding awe-inspiring rumble, to the voice of gods and powerful characters. Notable in the latter nuance is the compound with *brahma* (divine-voiced sound) , recurrent in our annotated sample (e.g. *lalitavistara* 169)[^ghosa-5]. In contexts related to music and ceremonies *ghoṣa* tends to be compounded with the names of musical instruments, especially powerful ones, as in "śaṅkha-nirghoṣi-ghoṣaiḥ".[^ghosa-6] The resonant quality of *ghoṣa* comes to the fore with lexical associations involving natural phenomena, such as thunder and avalanches (gaṇḍavyūhasūtra 3)[^ghosa-7]

[^ghosa-5]: hā mama bal\^opapetā narāyaṇa-sthāmavan nihata-śatru-gaṇā / hā mama su-māñja-**ghoṣā** kalaviṅka-ruta-svarā madhura-brahma-rutā // 15.129 // *lalitavistara* 169\
    "Alas, my powerful man, who is as strong as Nārāyaṇa, You conquer the hordes of demons. Alas, my gentle love with a voice as sweet as Brahmā’s And as soft as the sound of a nightingale." \[Dahl et al./84000 15.189\]

[^ghosa-6]: *saṃpanne aṅguṣṭha-padme jhaṭiti hṛdi tathā kaṇṭha ev\^opakaṇṭhe ḍhakkā-saṃkāśa-tālaiḥ kalapaṭu-paṭahaiḥ śaṅkha-nirghoṣi-**ghoṣaiḥ** / hā hā huṃ hūṃ kṛtā ye jhaṭiti kaṭakaṭair bhīma-nād\^ānumodaiḥ kṣudraṃ ceto na c\^aitat su-rava-rajayino yasya tasmai namo astu* // 29. 22 // *bauddhastotrasaṃgrahaḥ* 29

[^ghosa-7]: *śailendra-rāja-saṃghaṭṭana-**ghoṣeṇa** ca /* *gaṇḍavyūhasūtra* 3\
    "\[…\] Sound of Mountains Colliding, \[…\]." \[Cleary 1136\]

### <font color='indianred'>connotation</font> {#sec-connotation}

The word ghoṣa presents a predominant neutral connotation, as befits the its typical deployment in descriptive rather than evaluative contexts. Still, several of the descriptions it participates have a distinctively positive coloring, which lends ghoṣa a positive semantic prosody. In our annotated data, this occurs mostly when *ghoṣa* is associated with divine or Buddha-speech, as exemplified in the *Lalitavistara*: "su-madhura-vacanā manojña-ghoṣā śaśi va praśānti-karā prasanna-cittā".[^ghosa-8] Negative and neutral-to-negative semantic prosody is rare in our annotated sample, indicating that even if the semantic spectrum of this word touches on the concept of verbalization, denoting the sound of voices, this word not part of the yogācāra critique of language; unlike the near-synonym ruta, whose has stronger connection to the idea of verbal expression made it a target of much criticism, e.g. in the *Laṅkāvatārasūtra*.

[^ghosa-8]: *su-madhura-vacanā manojña-**ghoṣā** śaśi va praśānti-karā prasanna-cittā / prahasita-vadanā prabhūta-jihvā parama-su-prīti-karā mune namaste //* *lalitavistara* 266\
    "You whose speech is exceedingly melodious and whose cadence is captivating, Who is soothing and clear minded like the moon, Whose face is smiling and whose tongue is long, To you, Supreme Enrapturing Sage, we pay homage!" \[Dahl et al./84000 23.59\]
