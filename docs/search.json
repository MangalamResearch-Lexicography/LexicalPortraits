More specifically, vitarka is thought that surfaces to our attention spontaneously (thought esp. spontaneous & distracting), typically triggered by sense impressions, memories, or desires.\nMany occurrences imply a tinge of lust or malice. For example, vitarka often indicates thoughts that linger on the prospect of meeting an attractive partner or, more darkly, on the prospect of violence. Whether these thoughts amount to fantasising, scheming, or engaging in a mental dialogue over the matter at hand is not clear. It is likely that vitarka was rather vague regarding this point, lending itself to take on all these different semantic nuances depending on context. The one aspect of thought that vitarka appears to foreground in non-specialised contexts is its unwitting, unintentional nature, with vitarka being typically characterized as distracting.\nThe unfocussed nature of vitarka is at the root of its terminological uses as the first dhyānāṅga and as a caitasika dharma. In the former application, vitarka denotes the initial, unfoccused, phase in mental progression that leads to meditative absorption . In the latter, it denotes a neutral mental factor traditionally held responsible for the initial steering of the mind towards an object of thought . These two meanings often overlap, since the caitasika dharma can function as the first dhyānāṅga. Hence we have merged these two specialized applications under the single label ‘a caitasika dharma’\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: semantic tree"

About two thirds of all attestations of this word in the Segmented Buddhist Sanskrit Corpus occur in śāstras (422 out of 637 attestations). This does not necessarily indicate that vitarka gravitates towards the philosophical or technical  register. Attestations of the word vitarka in narrative and non-specialized contexts suggest that the use of this word is  not restricted to the philosophical discourse, with the every-day character of some attestations even tilting towards a  general language feel, e.g. :\n\nIf a man, moved by considerations of greed, had made a date with a handsome, attractive and good-looking woman, and if now that woman were held back by someone else and could not leave her house, what do you think, Subhuti, with what would that man’s preoccupations be connected? Subhuti: With the woman, of course. He thinks about her coming, about the things they will do together, and about the joy, fun and delight he will have with her.

    "text": "3.4 context\nThe predominance in śāstra materials is probably due to two factors. First, the topic to which this word is associated. That is, the torments and distractions brought about by worldly attachments, notably love and desire. As the even diachronic distribution of vitarka suggests, this topic is close to the core of Buddhist thought and largely unaffected by the waxing and waning of specific schools and philosophical controversies.\nAll kinds of treatises touch upon this matter, especially (but far from exclusively) in the  context of meditation, hence the relatively high volume of occurrences of this word in sāstras. Some 80% of the attestation of vitarka we sampled from the Bodhisattvabhūmi, foreground this aspect of vitarka.\nSecond, as mentioned in the introductory paragraph, a ‘technical’ sense developed from the general senses of vitarka to term one of the caitasika dharma (and one of the dhyānāṅga). Terminological applications of the word are responsible for three quarters of the attestations we sampled from the Abhidharmakośabhāṣya, and is likely to play a major role in other śastras as well. In its specialized sense, vitarka is typically accompanied by vicāra, the caitasika dharma that is described as following vitarka in the chain of mental events leading to meditative concentration.\nThe statistically significant collocates of vitarka depicted in the wordcloud below clearly point to these two uses of vitarka, the more general sense of distracting lustful thought and the specialized sense the caitasika dharma precursor of vicāra, and to its prominence in the context of meditation.\n\nkeywordsinfo\n\n\n\n\nThe size of words in the wordcloud is proportional to the number of texts in which a keyword co-occur with the headword.\nwords in red occur together with the lemma in at least 24% of the texts and are over-represented in the immediate context of the headword with Log Likelyhood over 290, Log Ratio over 3.6.\nThe number shown when hovering over the words is the proportion of texts in which a keyword occurs in the vicinity of the headword.\n\n\n\n\nthe wordcloud and table display words that are statististically over-represented in the immediate context of the lemma (defined as the words that occur in the same sentece as the lemma), compared to their overall frequency in the rest of the ~7-million words Segmented Corpus of Buddhist Sanskrit.\nThe statistics used for keyness are Log Likelyhood over 10, Log Ratio over 2.

    "text": "3.5 connotation\nVitarka tends to acquire a rather negative semantic prosody, especially in non-specialised contexts. It is depicted as an unwanted distraction harassing meditators and it is often modified by adjectives such as akuśala or asat. Still, within the sampled attestations used for our dictionary, only a minority of instances of vitarka have an overtly negative connotation, with vitarka itself being portrayed as ‘bad’.\nIn most cases vitarka appears to have a neuter connotation; the negative nuance, when present, mostly comes from the surrounding words. For example, when vitarka is described a akuśala in a passage this does not imply that vitarka is always akuśala, kuśala vitarka may be possible in different contexts (e.g. Vigrahavyāvartanī, 232).1\nvitark^ātiśayas tasya hṛdi saṃpravijṛmbhitaḥ / āviś-cakre prasādaś ca prabhāvaś ca divaukasām // [Āryaśūra_jātakamālā, 6.17] “Now, when that sublime reflection had presented itself to the Great Being’s mind, the Celestials manifested their propitiousness and their power.” [Speyer 57]\nIndeed in a small minority of our sampled sentences, vitarka displays a distinctly positive nuance, but this seems to be a departure from the general trend in our corpus, which points to a neuter connotation of the word vitarka itself and to rather negative semantic prosody due to its frequent appearence in negative contexts.\nThe negative semantic prosody is less pronounced for the terminological application of vitarka, but still visible in half the sentences we annotated, where its rudimentary and unfocussed nature is often emphasised and contrasted with the more subtle form of mental engagement denoted by the word vicāra.\n\nsemantic prosody proportionabsolute freqinfoexamples\n\n\n\n\nThe barcharts are based on manually annotated data.

Generally the semantic prosody associated to a word emerges from a repeated pattern of use. For example we can say that ‘set in’ has a negative connotation in English because it is systematically associated with words that possess a negative connotation (Louw 1993). For a pattern to emerge, we need to consider many individual instances. To this end in this project we treat semantic prosody slightly differently and we annotate it in each citation as a property of each instantiation of a lemma in context.\nWe use a fourfold typology for semantic prosody: positive, negative, neutral and neutral-nagative. We annotate a lemma as having negative semantic prosody when the concept expressed by the lemma is clearly depicted as negative , e.g. the lemma vikalpa in the phrase vikalpasaṃsārāvahāka (vikalpa is the source of saṃsāra).\nConversely, we annotate semantic prosody as positive if the concept expressed by a lemma is described as positive, or leading to something good etc. In cases where the lemma is negated (e.g. na vikalpayati) or is modified by an adjective with a negative connotation which suggests that some aspects of the concept expressed by the lemma are negative ( but not the concept tout-court, e.g. akuśala-vikalpa), we annotate the semantic prosody as being neutral-negative.\nGiven the rarity of positive semantic prosody in the vocabulary explored in the Visual Dictionary and Thesaurus of Buddhist Sanskrit we categorize all positive occurrences as pos, even when they would better lend themselves to neu.pos, for analogy with neu.neg above.\n\n\n\n3.5.0.1 negative\nsormik^eva hi nadī vitarka-vicāra-kṣobhitā saṃtatir a-prasannā vartate iti / [abhidharmakośabhāṣya, 440.06.440.07] “As a river agitated by waves, so too the series, by reason of the agitation of vitarka and vicāra, is not calm or clear.” [Pruden 1236]\njñātvā vidvān vitarkāṃs tu manaḥ-saṃkṣobha-kārakān tad-viyuktam avāpnoti dhyānaṃ prīti-sukh^ānvitam // [buddhacarita, 12.51] “But when the wise man realizes that discursive thought perturbs the mind, He attains the trance that’s divorced from that, and containing delight and joy.” [Olivelle 345]\n\n\n3.5.0.2 neuter-negative\n[…] tasya khalu śrutavata ārya-śrāvakasy^aivaṃ carata evaṃ viharataḥ kadācit karhicit smṛti-saṃpramoṣād utpadyante pāpakā a-kuśalā vitarkā iti / [abhidharmakośabhāṣya, 376.23.376.25] “A wise Āryan Śrāvaka who follows this rule of life, who passes his time in this way –it happens sometimes, through weakness of mindfulness, that he produced bad thoughts.” [Pruden 1009]\nārabdha-vīryasya manaḥ-śamāya bhūyas tu tasy^ā-kuśalo vitarkaḥ / vyādhi-praṇāśāya niviṣṭa-buddher upadravo ghora iv^ājagāma // [saundarananda, 17.8] “But again an evil thought approached him when all his energy was applied to attaining tranquillity of mind, like a fearful symptom coming, on a man whose mind is set on the destruction of his illness.” [Johnston 102]\nte ced a-labdha-pratipakṣa-bhāvā n ^ aiv ^ opaśāmyeyur a-sad-vitarkāḥ / muhūrtam apy a-prativadhyamānā gṛhe bhujaṅgā iva n^ādhivāsyāḥ // [saundarananda, 16.81] “If evil thoughts are not allayed owing to failure to find the correct counteragent, still they must not be tolerated for a moment without opposition, any more than snakes in the house would be.” [Johnston 97]\n\n\n3.5.0.3 neuter\natha vimalakīrtir licchavir āyuṣmataḥ śāriputrasya ceto-vitarkam ājñāy^āyuṣmantaṃ śāriputram etad avocat [vimalakīrtinirdeśa, 5.1] “The Licchavi Vimalakīrti read the thought of the venerable Śāriputra and said, […].” [Thurman 50]\n[…] buddh^ānubhāvena svakena ca ṛddhi-balena ceto-vitarka-mātreṇa iha sahāyāṃ lokadhātau bhagavataḥ śākyamūneḥ purastāt pratyaṣṭhāt / [tathāgatācintyaguhya, 3v] “[…] by virtue of the power of his ṛddhi, he reappeared in this world Sahā, in the presence of the Blessed One Śākyamuni simply by thinking it.” [Lugli]\n\n\n3.5.0.4 positive\nvitark^ātiśayas tasya hṛdi saṃpravijṛmbhitaḥ / āviś-cakre prasādaś ca prabhāvaś ca divaukasām // [Āryaśūra_jātakamālā, 6.17] “Now, when that sublime reflection had presented itself to the Great Being’s mind, the Celestials manifested their propitiousness and their power.” [Speyer 57]\nsatyeṣu duḥkh^ādiṣu dṛṣṭir āryā samyag-vitarkaś ca parākramaś ca / idaṃ trayaṃ jñāna-vidhau pravṛttaṃ prajñ^āśrayaṃ kleśa-parikṣayāya // [saundarananda, 16.31] “The noble doctrine with respect to the Truths regarding suffering etc., right thought and exertion, these three, resting on intuitive wisdom, should be practised in the department of knowledge for the abolition of the vices.” [Johnston 92]\niha dharm^āvasthā-vido manyante kuśalānāṃ dharmāṇām ekonaviṃśaṃ-śatam / […] vitarkānāṃ prīteḥ pramādasya a-prasrabdheḥ / [vigrahavyāvartanī, 232] “In this context, people who know the state of things have the 119 auspicious things in mind.

If a person is a distinct entity like visible form and other such things, he is substantially real; but if [by analysis] he is [shown to be] a collection [of substances], like milk and other such things, he is real by way of a conception.” [Duerlinger 73]\nThe core meaning of prajñapti (also spelled prajñāpti) is close to its etymological sense, which conveys the idea of ‘making known’. In our corpus, this broad sense finds two main semantic applications, the closely related meaning of verbal expression and the derived sense of designating something for a specific use (designating for a use/allocating), which typically refers to allocating seats to participants in an assembly (e.g Divyāvadāna, 468.017). 1\nThe former sense is by far the most widespread and semantically nuanced. It comprises several different uses, all of which stand on continuum between verbal expressions and their cognitive counterpart, that is, concepts and notions, e.g. Abhidharmakośabhāṣya, 140. 2\nThis latter use (labelled verbal expression/notion), finds a specialized application in the Buddhist ontological discourse, especially (but not exclusively) in abhidharmic contexts, where it comes to denote the merely conceptual nature of phenomena ,or nominal existence (+sat). In this sense, prajñapti is typically compounded with sat and contrasted with dravya-sat, e.g. Abhisamayālaṃkāra, 5.5. 3\nIn contrast to this specialized meaning, the sense of prajñapti as verbal expression is much broader. It encompasses one-word designations (e.g. Mahāvastu, 1.351) 4 as well as statements and lengthy expositions, such as the exposition/formulation of teachings and monastic rules (e.g. Bhikṣuṇīvinaya, 179). 5 In this sense, prajñapti features in the title of several works and in our corpus it appears to refer to the title of a treatise in particular, e.g. Abhidharmakośabhāṣya, 419) 6\nThe boundaries between these uses of prajñapti tend to be blurry. The semantic categorization we provide is, at best, porous, as it is often impossible to determine whether in a given passage this word refers to a designation, a notion or an entity that is only taken to exist nominally.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: semantic tree"

Even the sense of designating something for use, which recurs in storytelling settings, appears to be crystallized in a formula and lack the contextual malleability of general-language words.  The meaning of exposition/application, too, has a formulaic flavor in the Vinaya (see examples from the Bhikṣuṇivanaya) where it denotes the codification of rules, a meaning that emerges also in other genres, where prajñapti expresses a sense close to the English ‘precepts’ (e.g. Bodhicāryāvatara, 2.63).

    "text": "2.4 context\nPrajñapti’s polysemy is reflected in the variety of contexts in which it occurs.\nThe sense of designating something for a use is typically instantiated in passages describing the preparations made for hosting an assembly and accompanied by the collocate āsana, although a wider range of words can be governed by prajñapti in this sense (see also the cognate prajñapta, which expresses a similar sense).\nIn the specialized sense of nominal existence, prajñapti occurs in the context of ontological discussions, where it is usually contrasted with dravya and accompanied by sat, as well as words associated with key Buddhist ontological issues, such as pudgala and skandha.\nA similar, but broader context frames prajñapti’s instantiations of the senses verbal expression/notion and designation, both of which typically occur in passages related to the Mahāyāna discourse on language. Here, prajñapti tends to be accompanied by the usual lexical markers of Mahāyāna reflections on reality, such as dharmatā and mātra, as well as by its near-synonyms saṃjñā, vyavahāra and saṃketa. In this regard, it is important to note that while prajñapti is semantically and contextually close to both vyavahāra and saṃketa, the idea of conventionality is less central to prajñapti than to these two words. Contrary to vyavahāra and saṃketa, prajñapti foregrounds the purely communicative aspect of verbalization, rather than its social and transactional dimensions.\n\n\nBodhicaryāvatāra (2.63: prakṛtyā yac ca sāvadyaṃ prajñapty^āvadyam eva ca): ‘péché contre la loi naturelle, péché contre les lois de la Confrérie’.\nThe meaning of ‘precepts’, or more generally exposition/formulation, is the most widely spread of prajñapti’s senses in our corpus, and it is especially prominent in the context of vinaya literature\nVerses that contrast prajñapti with prakṛti have sometimes been taken as evidence for interpreting this lemma as denoting what is conventional as opposed to what is natural (notably Edgerton sub voce prajñapti). However, one set of these verses, Śikṣāsamuccaya 192.13 (na teṣām a-sāmarthye api prakṛti-duṣṭatvād gṛhāvāsasya ca prajñapti-sāvadyatvād iti //), depicts the houselder’s life as ‘blameworthy’ by prajñapti, and it is doubtful that such way of life was considered ‘blameworthy by convention’ (Edgerton’s rendition) in ancient India. ‘Precepts’ may be a more natural interpretion of prajñapti here, in line with de la Vallee Poussin’s translation of a similar stanza in the Bodhicaryāvatāra (2.63: prakṛtyā yac ca sāvadyaṃ prajñapty^āvadyam eva ca): ‘péché contre la loi naturelle, péché contre les lois de la Confrérie’.\nThe meaning of ‘precepts’, or more generally exposition/formulation, is the most widely spread of prajñapti’s senses in our corpus, and it is especially prominent in the context of vinaya literature.

    "text": "2.5 connotation\nOverall, prajñapti has a neutral connotation.\nHowever, when it expresses the meaning of exposition/formulation, especially in the context of the Buddha’s teaching, it is sometimes surrounded by words with a markedly positive connation. These words lend a positive semantic prosody to prajñapti in about 20% of the citations that we manually annotated with this sense (in yellow in the chart).\nBy contrast, when it expresses the meanings of verbal expression/notion and nominal existence, prajñapti acquires a slighly negative semantic prosody in about 30% of the citations we annotated (in pale red in the graph). The negative tinge mostly derives from emphasis on the ‘mere’ nominal value and illusoriness of entities that exist by way of prajñapti.\n\n\nsemantic prosody (sem.pros) here refers to whether a lemma acquires a positive or negative overtone in context.\n\nsemantic prosody proportionabsolute freqinfoexamples\n\n\n\n\nThe barcharts are based on manually annotated data.

Generally the semantic prosody associated to a word emerges from a repeated pattern of use. For example we can say that ‘set in’ has a negative connotation in English because it is systematically associated with words that possess a negative connotation (Louw 1993). For a pattern to emerge, we need to consider many individual instances. To this end in this project we treat semantic prosody slightly differently and we annotate it in each citation as a property of each instantiation of a lemma in context.\nWe use a fourfold typology for semantic prosody: positive, negative, neutral and neutral-nagative. We annotate a lemma as having negative semantic prosody when the concept expressed by the lemma is clearly depicted as negative , e.g. the lemma vikalpa in the phrase vikalpasaṃsārāvahāka (vikalpa is the source of saṃsāra).\nConversely, we annotate semantic prosody as positive if the concept expressed by a lemma is described as positive, or leading to something good etc. In cases where the lemma is negated (e.g. na vikalpayati) or is modified by an adjective with a negative connotation which suggests that some aspects of the concept expressed by the lemma are negative ( but not the concept tout-court, e.g. akuśala-vikalpa), we annotate the semantic prosody as being neutral-negative.\nGiven the rarity of positive semantic prosody in the vocabulary explored in the Visual Dictionary and Thesaurus of Buddhist Sanskrit we categorize all positive occurrences as pos, even when they would better lend themselves to neu.pos, for analogy with neu.neg above.\n\n\n\n2.5.0.1 positive\npratibhāna-pratisaṃvidā yathā-prajñapty-a-vikopanatay^ā-paryantatayā dharmaṃ deśayati // [daśabhūmikasūtra, 51]\n“By the analytical knowledge of eloquence he teaches doctrine with unshaken infinitude as his ideation.” [Honda 245-6]\n\n\n2.5.0.2 negative\nyath^oktam ātmā ātm^eti bhikṣavo bālo ’śrutavān pṛthagjanaḥ prajñaptim anupatito na tv atr^ātmā vā ātmīyaṃ vā iti /[abhidharmakośabhāṣya, 140]\n“It is said in fact, ‘The fool, the ignorant, the Pṛthagjana, conforming to the manners of vulgar speech, thinks “me,” or “mine;” but there is not any “me” or “mine.”’” [Pruden 419]\n\n\n2.5.0.3 neu\nkiṃ kāraṇaṃ pratyutpanne adhvani śrāvaka-pratyekabuddha-bodhisattvānāṃ prajñaptiḥ prajñapyate ?

Without understanding the sublime meaning, one will not attain nirvana.” [Batchelor]\nAt its core, vyavahāra expresses the idea of common practice. (customary practice/common experience). Within this broad sense, its precise meaning is rather malleable. It can point to a specific behaviour or acquire a more subjective tinge and take up a meaning closer to experience, typically ordinary, everyday experience. 1\nOften context also narrows down vyavahāra’s meaning by highlighting which kind of common practices it refers to. In our corpus, these tends to be primarily communication and business practice. These contextual specifications yield the meanings of mundane affairs and language usage.\nThe sense of mundane affairs, predominant in narrative literature, typically refers to trading and business activities,2 but can be stretched to also include the more specialized sense of legal proceedings, which is rare in our corpus but well attested in non-Buddhist sources.3\nThe sense of language usage (language usage/communication practice), predominant in sūtras and earlier śāstras, typically brings out the contrast between the inexpressibility of reality and the necessity to communicate it in words.4 Translations frequently represent this sense of vyavahāra as pertaining to “linguistic conventions”; however the conventional aspect of language as a set of agreed upon symbols is more precisely captured by the near synonym saṃketa. Vyavahāra appears rather to foreground the practical, de-facto, aspect of communication.5\nIt is often very difficult to tease apart the senses of vyavahāra. The boundaries between the sense of ordinary experience and language usage are especially blurry, as it often the case in Mahāyāna literature, where the cognitive and linguistic dimensions are deeply interrelated. Thus, a phrase like kāyādivyavahāro may refer to the words ‘body’ and so on or to the ordinary experience of conceiving people has having bodies.6 This ambiguity is notable in the context of the two truths, where vyavahāra may indicate the Dharma as it is taught verbally as well as the set of every day experiences any teaching inevitably needs to rely upon (see also section 3 below).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.1: semantic tree"

Still, despite the high frequency of vyavahāra in pramāṇa literature, this word does not seem to have undergone a process of technical specialization, at least not along the semantic lines drawn here. In fact, vyavahāra appears especially ambiguous in epistemological literature, where it is not always clear (at least not to reader less then well-versed in the pramāṇa discourse) whether vyavahāra refers to a verbal assertion regarding something (e.g. asserting that something is absent), to the ordinary experience of that thing (experiencing that something is absent) or to the common practice generally adopted towards it (treating it as absent).7 It may well be possible that these semantic distinctions are but an artefact of translation, and the Sanskrit word was fundamentally ambiguous.\n\nA passage from the Tarkābhāṣā is interesting in this regard. A parallel construction between vyavahāra √kṛ, which indicates a behaviour, and vyavahāra √sādh, which suggest a proposition, and the explication of trividho vyavahāra as including both kayika and vācika vyavahāra suggest either an intentional pun or that vyavahāra was perceived as intrinsically vague and able to express different semantic nuances within a single passage without compromising its coherence: abhāvavyavahāras tu mūḍhaṃ prati anupalambhena sādhyate / tathā hikaścinmūḍho rajaḥprabhṛtiṣu sāṅkhyaprasiddheṣu guṇeṣvanupalambhena pravartitābhāvavyavahāro ’pi punaḥ sarvaṃ sarvatrāstīti svasiddhāntābhyāsāt kvā ’pi pradeśādau ghaṭānupalambhe satyapi nābhāvavyavahāraṃ karotīty anupalambhena trividho vyavahāraḥ kāryate /tatra niḥśaṅkarāmanāgamanalakṣaṇaḥ kāyiko vyavahāraḥ / ghaṭo nāstīti vācikaḥ / īdṛśa eva antarjalpākāro mānasikaś ceti / (Tarkabhāṣā, 30)8\n\n\nFrequency by traditionfrequency by genre\n\n\n\n\nThe height of the bars in the charts indicates the normalized frequency of the lemma per 10,000 words, the colour of the bars indicates the absolute frequency.

    "text": "5.5 connotation\nVyavahāra has a neutral connotation, as befits the generic character of its core sense of ‘common practice’. It retains a mostly neutral connotation even in the sense of verbal practice, contrary to most o words related to the Mahāyāna discourse on language, which tend to acquire a negative semantic prosody in sūtras. This is because vyavahāra is seen mostly as a necessary, if imperfect, bridge towards paramārtha, rather than as a source of delusion. The sense of mundane affairs occurs in a positive prosody in narrative literature, but, predictably, assumes a negative tinge in pratimokṣa contexts, where dealing with money is forbidden.\n\nsemantic prosody proportionabsolute freqinfoexamples\n\n\n\n\nThe barcharts are based on manually annotated data.

Generally the semantic prosody associated to a word emerges from a repeated pattern of use. For example we can say that ‘set in’ has a negative connotation in English because it is systematically associated with words that possess a negative connotation (Louw 1993). For a pattern to emerge, we need to consider many individual instances. To this end in this project we treat semantic prosody slightly differently and we annotate it in each citation as a property of each instantiation of a lemma in context.\nWe use a fourfold typology for semantic prosody: positive, negative, neutral and neutral-nagative. We annotate a lemma as having negative semantic prosody when the concept expressed by the lemma is clearly depicted as negative , e.g. the lemma vikalpa in the phrase vikalpasaṃsārāvahāka (vikalpa is the source of saṃsāra).\nConversely, we annotate semantic prosody as positive if the concept expressed by a lemma is described as positive, or leading to something good etc. In cases where the lemma is negated (e.g. na vikalpayati) or is modified by an adjective with a negative connotation which suggests that some aspects of the concept expressed by the lemma are negative ( but not the concept tout-court, e.g. akuśala-vikalpa), we annotate the semantic prosody as being neutral-negative.\nGiven the rarity of positive semantic prosody in the vocabulary explored in the Visual Dictionary and Thesaurus of Buddhist Sanskrit we categorize all positive occurrences as pos, even when they would better lend themselves to neu.pos, for analogy with neu.neg above.\n\n\n\n5.5.0.1 negative\na-satsu sarva-dharmeṣu prajñaptiḥ kriyate mayā / abhilāpo vyavahāraś ca bālānāṃ tattva-varjitaḥ // laṅkāvatārasūtra , 135 \"I establish thought-constructions where all things are non-existent; whatever expressions and experiences that belong to the ignorant are not of the truth as it is.\" [Suzuki 259]\n*a-dṛṣṭe dṛṣṭa-vāditā a-śrute ‘mate ’vijñāte vijñāta-vāditā dṛṣṭe ’dṛṣṭa-vāditā yāvad vijñāte ’vijñāta-vāditā it^īme ’n-āryā aṣṭau vyavahārāḥ /* abhidharmakośabhāṣya, 245 \"[…] ’vocal actions’, eight of which are bad: to say that one has seen what one has not seen, to say that one has heard, cognized, or known what one has not heard, cognized, or known; to say that one has not seen when one has seen; and to say that one has not heard, cognized, or known when one has heard, cognized, or known; […].\" [Pruden 653]\nso a-paryavasita-kukārya-paryākulam upaśama-virodhi-prakṛṣṭ^-opāyāsam arth-opārjana-pradhāna-kāma-rati-vyavahār-āsāra-karma-dharma-bhūyiṣṭham a-vinaya-kalaha-vaira-vigrah^-āyatanam īrṣyā-mātsarya-caury^-ādi-niketa-bhūtaṃ śoka-parideva-duḥkha-daurmanasy^-opāyāsa-bahulaṃ māyā-śāṭhya-mada-māna-gahanaṃ sāha-sāvalep^-ādhiṣṭhitam an-ārya-vyavahār^-ānupravṛtti-jihma-sattva-bhāvaṃ pramāda-pada-sthānam an-eka-rūpa-paribhav^-opasṛṣṭaṃ saṃnihita-dainyam an-abhibhūta-viṣādaṃ pratyāsanna-vighāta-bhaya-daurgatyam a-viṣahy^-opadrava-samudraṃ kaṇṭaka-garbhād abhra-śvabhra-pratibhay^-ākaram apāsya gārhasthyam anyatamam a-śrama-padam abhyalaṃcakāra / jātakamālā_gopadatta, 11.3 \"Renouncing the state of a householder, (a state) that is full of unending evil deeds, that has strong mental disturbances, hostile to calmness, abundant in worthless activities and duties relating to the enjoyment of pleasures, the acquisition of wealth being the foremost, (a state) which is a repository of indiscipline, contention, hostility, and discord, an abode of jealousy, greed, robbery and the like, (a state) replete with sorrow, lamentation, misery, dejection, and irritation, (a state) which is crowded with deception, guile, arrogance and conceit, saturated with rashness and pride, characterized by a dishonest nature (resulting from) recourse to dishonourable behaviour, (a state) which is a foot-hold of indolence, afflicted with various kinds of humiliations, with wretchedness near at hand, with despondency not overcome, (a state) of distress (arising) from fear of imminent destruction, an ocean of unbearable misfortunes, a rich source of dangers of many hells filled with thorns, he (the Bodhisattva) lent splendour to a certain hermitage.\" [Handurukande 3]\n\n\n5.5.0.2 neuter-negative\nyo puna bhikṣur an-ekavidhaṃ jātarūpa-rajata-vikṛti-vyavahāraṃ samāpadyeya nissargika-pācattikam // prātimokṣasūtram_of_the_lokottaravādimahāsāṃghika, lnp20 \"Whatever monk should undertake activity in various sorts of sales in gold or silver, that is a nihsargika-pacattika.\" [Prebish 70]\nvyavahāram upādāya na punaḥ paramārthataḥ / jñānālokālaṃkāra, 58 \"This is based on conventional usage, but it is not in the ultimate sense.\" [Salvini/84000: Translating the Words of the Buddha 1.82]\nkṛtrimaṃ nāma vācyāśca dharmāste kalpitā yataḥ / śabdārthayorna sambandhastena svābhāviko mataḥ // 48 // bāhya-ārtha-ābhiniveśas tu bhrāntyā bālasya jṛmbhate / tath ^ aiva vyavahāro ayaṃ tv atr ārtho asti kaścana // 49 // prajñāpāramitāpiṇḍārtha, 48 “Name is factitious and things, in so far as they are nameable, are imputed; therefore it is impossible to think that the relation between the objects and their name corresponds to something essential.

    "text": "0.1 Preface\nLexical Portraits is a series of in-depth analyses of core Buddhist Sanskrit vocabulary launched by the Buddhist Translators Workbench in 2021, as part of the lexicographic programme run by the Mangalam Research Center.\nEach portrait is meant to be perused in conjunction with the corresponding entry in the Visual Dictionary and Thesaurus of Buddhist Sanskrit. While the dictionary entries allow interactive exploration of our manually annotated citations, the portraits offer our own interpretation of those citation as well as of corpus data. Contrary to the dictionary, where all charts are automated, the Portraits’ data-visualizations are manually tailored to each lemma. We recommend to always check the info tabs that accompany the portraits’ graphs, as the statistics and principles used to generate the graphs may vary from headword to headword.\nMore information about the editorial strategy and theoretical underpinnings of the Lexical Portraits series can be found in Ligeia Lugli (2021) Dictionaries as Collections of Lexical Data Stories: an alternative post-editing model for historical lexicography. eLex 2021 proceedings.\n\n0.1.1 coverage\nThe vocabulary we intend to cover in our Lexical Portrait is a subset of the headwords we are going to cover in the Visual Dictionary and Thesaurus of Buddhist Sanskrit. We prioritize words that are relatively frequent in the corpus, are difficult to translate, and lexicalize important concepts in Buddhism.\n\n\n0.1.2 corpus\nThe Lexical Portraits are based on a ~7 million words corpus of Buddhist Sanskrit literature that we are currently expanding thanks to funding from the  Khyentse Foundation.\nThe corpus is available on Zenodo; the info tabs of each portrait detail which version of the corpus has been used for a particular portrait.\nGraphs and information based on manual annotations draw on the subset of the corpus that is used for our dictionary. Please refer to the Corpus section of the Visual Dictionary and Thesaurus of Buddhist Sanskrit for a list of the texts included on the subcorpus we use for manual annotation.\n\n\n0.1.3 team\nThe Lexical Portraits are created by Ligeia Lugli on the basis of linguistic annotations by Luis Gamaliel Quiñones Martinez."
