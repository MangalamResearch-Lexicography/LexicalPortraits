### <font color='indianred'>overview</font> {#sec-overview}

The meaning of *cetanā* lies at the intersection between the semantic domains of `Thought` and `Will`, where it 
spans three distinct senses. First and foremost, *cetanā* refers to a form of `volitional thinking`, understood as the mental impulse behind bodily, verbal, or mental actions, especially in discussions about *karma*.[^cetana-1] In Abhidharma contexts, this sense finds a terminological application where cetanā serves as `a caitasika dharma`, specifically the mental factor that drives or urges the mind toward a specific object or goal.[^cetana-2] More broadly, *cetanā* also expresses the notion of `consciousness` intended as the defining characteristic of a sentient being.[^cetana-3]

[^cetana-1]: **cetanā** citt-\^ābhisaṃskāro manasaś ceṣṭā yasyāṃ satyām ālambanaṃ prati cetasaḥ praspanda iva bhavaty ayaskānta-vaśād ayaḥ-praspandavat / *triṃśikābhāṣya* 58\
    "Cetanā or will is the mental effort that conditions (re-arranges) the mind; which being there, the mind flows in a stream towards the object (of cognition) as does iron towards the mass of a magnet." \[Chatterjee 46\]

[^cetana-2]: \[…\] cakṣuḥ pratītya rūpāṇi c \^ otpadyate cakṣur-vijñānaṃ trayāṇāṃ saṃnipātaḥ sparśaḥ saha-jātā vedanā saṃjñā **cetan**\^eti / *abhidharmakośabhāṣya* 146\
    "(The Vaibhasikas:) If sensation is later than contact, you have to take into account the Sutra, 'By reason of the eye and visible things there arises visual consciousness; the coming together of the three is contact; together there arises (sahajāta) sensation, ideas, volition'." \[Pruden 429\]

[^cetana-3]: a-**cetanaś** ca n \^aiv \^āham a-caitanyāt paṭ-\^ādivat / atha jñaś **cetanā**-yogād a-jño naṣṭaḥ prasajyate // *bodhicaryāvatāra* 9.68\
    "That which is not conscious is not 'I' because it lacks con­sciousness like an object such as a cloth. If it is a conscious thing because it possesses consciousness it follows that when it stops being conscious of something it perishes." \[Crosby & Skilton 122\]

### <font color='indianred'>context</font> {#sec-context}

Collocational patterns featuring cetanā can be found throughout our corpus. The compound "**citt-ābhisaṃskāra**" (mental formation/volition) appears frequently, defining *cetanā*'s essential characteristic as mental activity that shapes consciousness.[^cetana-4] The compound "**vedanā-saṃjñā-cetanā**" (feeling-perception-volition) represents a standard enumeration of universal mental factors.

[^cetana-4]: **cetanā** citt-\^ābhisaṃskāro manasaś ceṣṭā yasyāṃ satyām ālambanaṃ prati cetasaḥ praspanda iva bhavaty ayaskānta-vaśād ayaḥ-praspandavat / *triṃśikābhāṣya* 58\
    "Cetanā or will is the mental effort that conditions (re-arranges) the mind; which being there, the mind flows in a stream towards the object (of cognition) as does iron towards the mass of a magnet." \[Chatterjee 46\]

Particularly significant is the karmic formulation "**cetanā karma cetayitvā ca**" (volition is karma, and having willed), which establishes *cetanā* as both the mental act of willing and the karmic force generated thereby.[^cetana-5] This dual function appears prominently in Abhidharma literature, where *cetanā* serves as the crucial link between mental intention and ethical consequence.

[^cetana-5]: tathā **cetanā** karma cetayitvā karma iti vacanāc ca / *bodhicaryāvatārapañjikā* 222\
    "And likewise in accordance with the statement, 'Intention (cetanā) is action; having intended is action.'" \[Oldmeadow 471.8\]

### <font color='indianred'>connotation</font> {#sec-connotation}

In our annotated data, the semantic prosody of *cetanā* is predominantly `neutral`.
Still, `positive` hues emerge in contexts discussing wholesome mental cultivation, e.g. in the *Lalitavistara*: "tasy \^aiva me viharataḥ prāptasya \^uttama-**cetanām**" (having attained supreme volition).
A more `negative` prosody occurs when the term is negated in discussions of ultimate reality, such as in the *Kāśyapaparivarta*: "yatra kāśyapa na **cetanā** na mano na vijñānam" (where there is neither volition, nor mind, nor consciousness).
