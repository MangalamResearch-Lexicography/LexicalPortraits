### <font color='indianred'>overview</font> {#sec-overview}

At its core, the term āśaya expresses two ideas: `intention`and`seat or base of something`. In our corpus, the former finds two closely related semantic applications: "**intention**" properly, as purposeful mental states or clearly verbalized aim (*rāṣṭrapālaparipṛcchā*)[^azaya-1]; and "**inclination**", as a less clearly defined, unconscious motivational basis or mental disposition behind actions and thoughts (*saddharmapuṇḍarīka* 28)[^azaya-2]. The distinction between these two senses is not always clear-cut, being more a continuum between a concrete, conscious intention and a more vague, underlying volitional disposition. In contrast to this specialized sense, the general and more concrete idea of `seat or base of something` typically denotes bodily containers or receptacles, particularly in medical or anatomical contexts. The *Arthaviniścayasūtra* provides clear examples: "pakk-āśayaḥ" (cooked-food container/stomach) and "vāyv-āśayaṃ" (wind container), demonstrating the term's concrete physical applications alongside its predominant psychological meanings.

[^azaya-1]: sarva-sattva-sama-citta sūratā eka-putrakavad īkṣate jagat / sarvam etad api mocayāmy aham evam **āśaya** tath \^āgra-pudgalāḥ // 51 // *rāṣṭrapālaparipṛcchā* 125\
    "The mild-mannered, who possess equanimity toward all sentient beings, behold the world like an only son: ‘I will liberate them all’—such is the intention of the highest men." \[Boucher 121\]

[^azaya-2]: te api sarve anuttarāyāḥ samyaksaṃbodher lābhino bhaviṣyanti // aham api śāriputra etarhi tathāgato arhan samyaksaṃbuddho bahujana-hitāya bahujana-sukhāya lok-\^ānukampāyai mahato janakāyasy \^ārthāya hitāya sukhāya devānāṃ ca manuṣyāṇāṃ ca nān-\^ābhinirhāra-nirdeśa-vividha-hetu-kāraṇa-nidarśan-\^ārambaṇa-nirukty-upāya-kauśalyair nān-\^ādhimuktānāṃ sattvānāṃ nānā-dhātv-**āśayānām** āśayaṃ viditvā dharmaṃ deśayāmi / *saddharmapuṇḍarīka* 28\
    "… out of pity to the world, for the benefit, weal, and happiness of the great body of creatures, and who preached the law to gods and men with able means, such as several directions and indications, various arguments, reasons, illustrations, fundamental ideas, interpretations, paying regard to the dispositions of creatures whose inclinations and temperaments are so manifold, …" \[Kern 40-1\]

### <font color='indianred'>connotation</font>

The semantic prosody of *āśaya* is fundamentally neutral but takes up various tinges in different cotexts. It takes a positive hue in compounds like *kalyāṇa-āśaya* ("good inclination") and *śuddha-āśaya* ("pure inclination") (*lalitavistara* 19)[^azaya-7].
