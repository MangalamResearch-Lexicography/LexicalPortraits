### <font color='indianred'>overview</font> {#sec-overview}

*Vastu* carves a considerable slice of the conceptual domain of `Existence`. Broadly speaking, *vastu* means 'what is there'. Within this broad and under-specified sense, it takes a variety of meanings, which are best conceived as standing on a continuum between denoting an ontological state, a state of affairs as well as individual, tangible objects. Specifically it can denote the `foundation/basis` of either reality in general[^vastu-1] or specific phenomena and experiences;[^vastu-2] or, more abstractly, it can mean a set of `matters or facts`.[^vastu-3] Most typically in our corpus it means `thing` or an individual object in general,[^vastu-4] one's `goods/possessions`.[^vastu-5] In philosophical discourse, it refers to an `object/entity`,[^vastu-6] typically understood as ontologically real,[^vastu-7] whose characteristics and expressibility are object of much debate in Buddhist literature. In this latter use, the boundaries between the sense `foundation/basis` and the sense `object/entity` are often porous, and it is difficult to determine whether (or to what extent) *vastu* is meant as the underlying ontological foundation of some characteristics, or for the application of verbal labels, or rather as the actual object to which such characteristics and names are attached.[^vastu-8] Finally, following from the ontological end of *vastu's* semantic spectrum, the adverbial form *vastutaḥ* expresses the idea of `in reality` and is used alongside *paramārthataḥ* and often contrasted with *vyavāhāra*.[^vastu-9]

[^vastu-1]: sa khalu bodhisattvas tena dūr\^ānupraviṣṭena dharma-nairātmya-jñānena nir-abhilāpya-svabhāvatāṃ sarva-dharmāṇāṃ yathābhūtaṃ viditvā na kiñcid vikalpayati n\^ānyatra **vast**u-mātraṃ gṛhṇāti tathatā-mātram / *bodhisattvabhūmi* 28\
    "Indeed, a bodhisattva who has realized the ineffable nature of all entities as it truly is with \[a form of\] the knowledge of the insubstantiality of phenomena that has long since penetrated \[into its meaning\] does not form any type of conceptual thought whatsoever and does not grasp anything other than the bare substance \[of entities\] and \[their\] bare suchness." \[Engle 72\]

    "Colour/shape, sound, taste, tactile sensation, smell and dharmas: these six are conceived as the basis of desire, hatred and stupidity." \[Batchelor\]

    "Misconduct should never be indulged in. That which relates to the community (sāṃghikaṃ vastu) is like a vase of fire (agnighaṭopamam), a poison (viṣopamam), a vajra (vajropamam), a burden (bharopamam)." \[Studholme 154\]

    "What is the essence of generosity? It is the volition of a bodhisattva who is indifferent toward all material objects as well as \[his or her\] own body, and \[a volition\] that arises together with \[an attitude that is\] free of acquisitiveness. It is also the deeds of body and speech that are caused to arise by that \[volition\] for the purpose of giving up those objects that are suitable to be given, …" \[Engle I.9.1\]

[^vastu-5]: priyāṇi **vastūni** tath \^aiva putrān dāsyāmi ca tvām aham arthinaḥ san / *gaNDavyUhasUtra* 322\
    "I will give away my prized possessions, Even my children, yet I want you; …" \[Cleary 1416\]

    "It is not reasonable for \[the Dharma nature\] to be a non-conceptual entity like space, because \[space\] permits a variety of concepts." \[Eckel 283\]

    "It is not reasonable for \[the Dharma nature\] to be a non-conceptual entity like space, because \[space\] permits a variety of concepts." \[Eckel 283\]

    "In a similar way, the conceptions and false notions that resemble physical objects and their actions and that are both created by a variety of expressions and accompanied by attachment to \[verbal\] elaborations arise in the ineffable reality that resembles space." \[Engle 441\]

[^vastu-9]: na tu paramārthato darśanam asti yen \^ aivaṃ dṛṣṭ\^-ādi-vyavahāraḥ / vedanā tena n\^ ekṣyate yena dṛṣṭa-sukha-sādhan\^-ādi-vyavahāro apy anyata eva tena kāraṇena vedanā n\^ ekṣyate na dṛśyate **vastutaḥ** // *bodhicaryāvatārapañjikā* 243\
    "\[…\] but there is not seeing absolutely because the seen etc. is likewise conventional usage. Therefore sensation is not perceived. Because even the conventional usage of the seen, means of bringing about pleasure etc. is as an other, for this reason sensation is not perceived." \[Oldmeadow 520.16\]

### <font color='indianred'>frequency</font> {#sec-frequency}

*Vastu* is among the top-frequency words in our corpus. Although it is more evenly dispersed across genres than the average words in our corpus, its frequency is decidedly over-represented in *śāstra*, in line with its role in ontological discussions. Following this trend, the commentarial period shows the highest normalized frequency.

### <font color='indianred'>context</font> {#sec-context}

Several collocational patterns featuring *vastu* are noteworthy. The phrase *vastu-mātra* (mere entity/object) appears frequently in Yogācāra literature, indicating the school's emphasis on consciousness-only doctrine.[^vastu-10] Particularly noteworthy is the *Bodhisattvabhūmi*'s extended discussion of *nir-abhilāpya vastu* (ineffable entity), the pre-verbal state of things that constitutes reality as it really is:[^vastu-11] "*nir-abhilāpyaṃ vastv ālambanī-kṛtya sarva-dharmeṣu yā tathatā*" (taking the ineffable entity as object, that suchness in all phenomena).

[^vastu-10]: \[…\] **vast**u-mātre 'rtha-mātre ālambane cittam upanibadhya sarva-prapañc\^āpagatena sarva-citta-pariplav\^āpagatena saṃjñā-manasikāreṇa sarv\^ālambanāny adhimucyamānaḥ adhyātma-samādhi-nimitteṣu cittaṃ saṃsthāpayati \[…\] *bodhisattvabhūmi* 77\
    "Through having fulfilled \[the practice\] of reflection with its eight aspects, a bodhisattva then bind their mind to an object that is beyond expression—one that is a bare substance and a bare import—and then, maintaining zealous devotion toward all meditation objects through bringing to mind conceptions that are free of all elaboration and mental unsteadiness, \[…\]." \[Engle 196-197\]

[^vastu-11]: nir-abhilāpyaṃ **vast**v ālambanī-kṛtya sarva-dharmeṣu yā tathatā nir-vikalpa-samatā niryātā prajñā \[…\] *bodhisattvabhūmi* 199\
    "\[…\] (1) the wisdom that, having taken hold of the ineffable reality, has developed an awareness of the suchness that pertains to all entities and the sameness that does not engage in conceptualization about them, \[…\]." \[Engle 482\]

### <font color='indianred'>connotation</font> {#sec-connotation}

The semantic prosody of *vastu* shows a predominantly **neutral** stance, with some notable negative hues and rare positive ones. A neutra-negative prosody characterizes philosophical discussions on emptiness,[^vastu-12] and the Yogācāra critique of language as not ontologically gounded: nir-vastuko hy abhilāpas tat saṃvṛty\^āpi na vidyate / viparyāsasya **vast**utvāc c\^opalabdhir na vidyate // \[*Laṅkāvatārasūtra,* 115\]\
"That which exists only as word and not as reality such is not to be found even in worldly knowledge; this comes from the nature of reality being erroneously understood, for no such perception is possible." \[Suzuki, 236\]

[^vastu-12]: *,na tad **vastu** bhāvo n\^ā-bhāvaḥ / abhilāpyen\^ātmanā a-pariniṣpannatvān na bhāvaḥ* / \[*bodhisattvabhūmi,* 37\]\
    "\[…\] that a substance is neither a thing that exists nor a thing that does not exist. Because its verbally described nature does not constitute an absolute mode of being, it is not a thing that exists." \[Engle, 99\]
