### <font color='indianred'>overview</font> {#sec-overview}

*dhātu* lexicalizes various aspects of the conceptual domain of `Existence`. At its core, it expresses the borad notion of foundation, which then finds several different semantic instantiations depending of the context. In Buddhist cosmological contexts, it means the foundation of a certain planes of existence, that is `realm\sphere` or `world`, such as the desire realm (kāmadhātu), form realm (rūpadhātu), and formless realm (ārūpyadhātu).[^dhatu-1] In the context of discussions of perception and cognition, *dhātu* denotes the `foundation of perception`, understood as various elemental categories such as the eighteen elements (*aṣṭādaśadhātu*) which include the six sense bases, their corresponding objects, and the consciousnesses arising from their contact.[^dhatu-2] *Dhātu* can also refer to the fundamental nature of a person, the inherent `character` of sentient beings that guides their actions and thoughts; [^dhatu-3] as well as to the foundation of the physical world, with the meaning `element`, e.g. the classical four great elements—earth, water, fire, and wind—sometimes expanded with space and consciousness.[^dhatu-4] In more practical semantic applications, *ahātu* can denote `bodily relic`, indicating the remains of the Buddha or other revered beings, such as bone fragments that are considered sacred and worthy of veneration;[^dhatu-5] and `metal ore`.[^dhatu-6] Finally, the same core notion of foundation extends to the domain of `Language`, where *dhātu* means "**verbal root**", understood as the fundamental constituent of language.[^dhatu-7]

    "Knowing her inclinations, propensities, makeup, and nature, he then gave her a discourse on the dharma that elucidated the four noble truths.

The slopes and declivities of that landscape were adorned by their picturesque scenery, which harmonized the inequality of colours and shapes and combinations, so that they seemed to have been arranged purposely and with care." \[Speyer 302\]

### <font color='indianred'>frequency & register</font> {#sec-frequency}

*Dhātu* is a high-frequency word in our corpus. However its occurrences are mostly concentrated in sūtra literature. Its normalized frequency is also high sādhanas and tantra, and low in all other genres. This suggest a preminence in religious discourse over philosophical or narrative contexts, which might have lent *dhātu* a distinctively formal ,perhaps even hieratic, register.

### <font color='indianred'>context</font> {#sec-context}

Our annotated data showcases several specialized compounds that position *dhātu*'s in the Buddhist cosmological vocabulary. The most frequent is **skandha-dhātv-āyatana**, which denotes a comprehensive categorization of existence.[^dhatu-8]

[^dhatu-8]: tasmāt tarhi mahāmate bodhisattvair mahāsattvais tathāgata-kāy\^-ānugamena pratilābhinā skandha-**dhātv**-āyatana-citta-hetu-pratyaya-kriyā-yog\^-otpāda-sthiti-bhaṅga-vikalpa-prapañca-rahitair bhavitavyaṃ citta-mātr\^-ānusāribhiḥ // *laṅkāvatārasūtra* 20\
    "Therefore, Mahāmati, these Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas who wish, by following the Tathāgatakaya, to realise it, should exercise themselves, in compliance with the truth of Mind-only, to desist from discriminating and reasoning erroneously on such notions as Skandhas, Dhātus, Āyatanas, thought, causation, deed, discipline, and rising, abiding, and destruction." \[Suzuki 39\]

**Dharma-dhātu** emerges as a particularly significant compound, often denoting the ultimate nature of reality, as exemplified in the *bodhicaryāvatārapañjikā.*[^dhatu-9] The **aṣṭādaśa dhātavaḥ** (eighteen elements) represents a systematic enumeration fundamental to Abhidharma analysis, while **loka-dhātu** (world-system) appears frequently in cosmological contexts.[^dhatu-10]

[^dhatu-9]: sarva-dharmāṇāṃ niḥ-svabhāvatā śūnyatā tathatā bhūta-koṭiḥ dharma-**dhātur** ity ādi paryāyāḥ / *bodhicaryāvatārapañjikā* 171\
    "Absence of essential nature, emptiness, suchness, real limit, sphere of the real etc. are synonyms." \[Oldmeadow 354.3\]

[^dhatu-10]: tatra bhikṣavaḥ katame 'ṣṭādaśa **dhāt**avaḥ ? tadyathā — cakṣur-dhātuḥ / rūpa-dhātuḥ / cakṣur-vijñāna-dhātuḥ / śrotra-dhātuḥ / śabda-dhātuḥ / śrotra-vijñāna-dhātuḥ / ghrāṇa-dhātuḥ / gandha-dhātuḥ / ghrāṇa-vijñāna-dhātuḥ / jihvā-dhātuḥ / rasa-dhātuḥ / *arthaviniścayasūtra* 311\
    "What, monks, are the eighteen elements? 'The eye element, form element, and eye-consciousness element; the ear element, sound element, and ear-consciousness element; the nose element, smell element, and nose-consciousness element; the tongue element, taste element, \[…\].'" \[Samtani 62\]

    yādṛśī ca sā sukhāvatī loka-**dhātuḥ** tādṛśaṃ tad buddha-kṣetraṃ bhaviṣyati / *ajitasenavyākaraṇa* 112\
    "… and that Buddha-field will be like the world-system of Sukhāvatī." \[Hirabayashi et al. 104\]

Specific element compounds like **pṛthivī-dhātu**, **ab-dhātu**, **tejo-dhātu**, and **vāyu-dhātu** represent the classical four-element analysis, while consciousness-related terms like **vijñāna-dhātu** and **mano-dhātu** reflect psychological categorizations.[^dhatu-11]

[^dhatu-11]: 1—1 catvāri mahābhūtāni katamāni / pṛthivī-dhātur ab-dhātus tejo-**dhātur** vāyu-dhātuś ca // *pañcaskandhaka* 1\
    "What are the four great elements? The earth constituent, the water constituent, the fire constituent, and the air constituent." \[Engle 229\]

    iti mahārāja vijñāna-**dhātur** vijñāna-dhātutvena śūnyo n opalabhyate anyatra vyavahārāt / *śikṣāsamuccaya* 250\
    "Your Majesty, the consciousness element is empty of being the consciousness element, and is not apprehended except in virtue of social convention." \[Goodman 239\]

### <font color='indianred'>connotation</font> {#sec-connotation}

*Dhātu* reveals a predominantly **neutral** semantic prosody, with occurrence in some notable positive context and rare negative use. A positive connotation emerges primarily in *Tathāgatagarbha* contexts, such as "*nirvāṇa-dhātur iti bhagavaṃs tathāgata-dharmakāyasy\^aitad adhivacanam*," where *dhātu* denotes the pure Buddha-nature.[^dhatu-12] A neutral-negative prosody occurs in contexts of philosophical negation, as exemplified in passages like "skandha-dhātv-āyatan-\^ādi-svabhāvatayā bhagavatā bhāvāḥ sūtre deśitāḥ" where conventional categories are deconstructed.[^dhatu-13]

[^dhatu-12]: "‘The Sphere of the Nirvāṇa, Lord, is the name for the Absolute Body of the Tathāgata’." \[Takasaki 261\]

[^dhatu-13]: \[…\] apy a-vidyā-niryātānāṃ skandha-**dhāt**v-āyatan\^opagānāṃ sarva-dharmāṇāṃ traidhātuk\^opapannānāṃ dṛṣṭa-sukha-saṃsthānām abhilāpya-gati-viśeṣāḥ / *laṅkāvatārasūtra* 8\
    "From ignorance there develop the Skandhas, Dhātus, Āyatanas, with all kinds of objects accompanying, which grow out in the triple world where we have, as we see, happiness, form, speech, and behaviour, each differentiating \[infinitely\]." \[Suzuki 17-18\]
