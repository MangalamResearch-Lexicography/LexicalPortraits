:::

At its core, vyavahāra expresses the idea of <b>common practice</b>. (<font color='#4682B4'>customary practice/common experience</font>). Within this broad sense, its precise meaning is rather malleable. It can point to a specific behaviour or acquire a more subjective tinge and take up a meaning closer to experience, typically ordinary, everyday experience. [^vyavahara-1]

[^vyavahara-1]: *nāyaṃ pratītivirodhalakṣaṇo doṣaḥ / kutaḥ? yogināṃ pudgalanairātmyasamādhilābhināṃ yā saṃvṛtirvyavahāraḥ, tayā kṣaṇikatayā pratīteḥ / ayam abhiprāyaḥ- yadi nāma arvāgdarśanaiḥ kṣaṇikatvaṃ na pratīyate, tathāpi yogivyavahāragocaraḥ /* (bodhicaryāvatārapañjikā 182). There is not the fault characterised as being contrary to perception. Why? Because they are perceived as momentary by way of the conventional truth, conventional usage, of the yogins who have obtained meditative concentration on the non-self of the person. This is the intent: Even if momentariness is not perceived by those seeing this side, nevertheless, it is the object of the conventional usage of yogins (Oldmeadow 377.12)

Often context also narrows down vyavahāra's meaning by highlighting which kind of common practices it refers to. In our corpus, these tends to be primarily communication and business practice. These contextual specifications yield the meanings of <b>mundane affairs</b> and <b>language usage</b>.

The sense of <b>mundane affairs</b>, predominant in narrative literature, typically refers to trading and business activities,[^vyavahara-2] but can be stretched to also include the more specialized sense of legal proceedings, which is rare in our corpus but well attested in non-Buddhist sources.[^vyavahara-3]

[^vyavahara-2]: ca sukhita-jana-manuṣyaṃ ca praśānta-daṇḍa-ḍamaraṃ su-nigṛhīta-taskaraṃ \<b\>vyavahāra\</b\>-sampannaṃ // (Mahāvastu, 1.272) "His kingdom was prosperous, flourishing and peaceful, had plenty of food, and was well and thickly peopled with happy subjects. Violence and riot had ceased, robbers were held in check, and commerce thrived." \\\[Jones vol. I 225\\\]

[^vyavahara-3]: *iṣṭeṣv an-iṣṭeṣu ca kāryavatsu na rāga-doṣ\^āśrayatāṃ prapede śivaṃ siṣeve vyavahāra-śuddhaṃ yajñaṃ hi mene na tathā yathā tat //* buddhacarita 2.39 "**Toward litigants,** whether friend or foe, he never displayed either love or hate;**honesty in court** he practiced as a sacred act, for he deemed it better than a sacrificial rite." \[Olivelle 49\]

The sense of <b>language usage</b> (<font color='#4682B4'>language usage/communication practice</font>), predominant in sūtras and earlier śāstras, typically brings out the contrast between the inexpressibility of reality and the necessity to communicate it in words.[^vyavahara-4] Translations frequently represent this sense of vyavahāra as pertaining to "linguistic conventions"; however the conventional aspect of language as a set of agreed upon symbols is more precisely captured by the near synonym *saṃketa*. Vyavahāra appears rather to foreground the practical, de-facto, aspect of communication.[^vyavahara-5]

[^vyavahara-4]: *na hi vyavahāra-satyam an-āgamya śakyā dharma-deśanā kartuṃ /* vigrahavyāvartanī 266 ("For it is not without having had recourse to the conventional truth that the nature of things can be explained." \[Westerhoff 29\])

[^vyavahara-5]: *tasmāt tathāgato mahākāruṇiko lokasya \^ uttrāsapadaparihār \^ ārthaṃ \*\*vyavahāra\*\*vaśād uktavān; utpadyate nirudhyate c \^ eti na c \^ ātra kasyacid dharmasya \^ utpādaḥ iti /* bhāvanākrama1&3 77 ("Therefore, the supremely compassionate Tathagata, in order to abolish the world's areas of fear had said for practical reasons, that 'there is birth, there is cessation', and certainly not (for the reason) that, in the ultimate sense, any dharma is born." \[Sharma 24\]) ; *na c\^otpadyā na c\^otpannāḥ pratyayo 'pi na kecana / saṃvidyante kvacit tena vyavahāraṃ tu kathyate //* laṅkāvatārasūtra 113 ("There is nothing that is to be born, nor is there anything that has been born; even causation is not; it is because of worldly usage that things are talked of as existing." \[Suzuki 75\])

It is often very difficult to tease apart the senses of vyavahāra. The boundaries between the sense of ordinary experience and language usage are especially blurry, as it often the case in Mahāyāna literature, where the cognitive and linguistic dimensions are deeply interrelated. Thus, a phrase like *kāyādivyavahāro* may refer to the words 'body' and so on or to the ordinary experience of conceiving people has having bodies.[^vyavahara-6] This ambiguity is notable in the context of the two truths, where vyavahāra may indicate the Dharma as it is taught verbally as well as the set of every day experiences any teaching inevitably needs to rely upon (see also section 3 below).

[^vyavahara-6]: avadhāraṇe vā tu śabdaḥ / tathā hi anavarāgra-saṃsāra-pravṛtti-janma-paraṃpara-ā-paricita-mithya-ābhyāsa-vāsanā-vaśāt yath \^ āvasthita-vastu-tattva-pratipattāv api tad viparīta-samāropa-kalpanā upajāyate / tad upanibaddho ayaṃ kāya-ādi-**vyavahāro** loke pravartate na tu pāramārthika iti // (bodhicaryāvatārapañjikā 233) "Or the word 'but' (tu) in the sense of emphasis. For so it is: On account of the latent impressions of mistaken practice accumulated over a series of births active in saṃsāra without beginning or end. Even when there is understanding of the reality of things as they are, a conceptual construction vontrary (sic) to that arises. This convetional expression of 'body' etc. connected to that is active in the world. But \[the body\] is not absolute." \[Oldmeadow 498.6\]

## <font color='indianred'>frequency</font>

Vyavahāra is a <code>fairly frequent</code> word with a very <code>uneven distribution</code> across our corpus, with its frequency peaking in the 'commentarial' period, between the VI and XI century. This is due mostly to the type of topics to which it is associated.

It is rare in narrative literature, where according to our sampled sentences it instantiates mostly the sense of mundane affairs, and it is not very frequent in sūtra and early śāstras, where it is loosely tied to the discourse on language and the two truths, while it is <code>hugely over-represented in later philosophical literature</code>, where it appears strongly related to the <code>pramāṇa discourse</code> (see by freq by tradition graph in the next section).

## <font color='indianred'>register</font> {#sec-register}

Based on our sampled sentences, the distribution of vyavahāra's senses across text types suggests that the meaning <code>mundane affairs</code> might have been closer to <code>general language use</code>, whereas that<code>language usage</code>, being mostly instantiated in philosophical literature, might have belonged to a <code>more scholastic register</code>. Still, despite the high frequency of vyavahāra in pramāṇa literature, this word does <code>*not* seem to have undergone a process of technical specialization</code>, at least not along the semantic lines drawn here. In fact, vyavahāra appears especially ambiguous in epistemological literature, where it is not always clear (at least not to reader less then well-versed in the pramāṇa discourse) whether vyavahāra refers to a verbal assertion regarding something (e.g. asserting that something is absent), to the ordinary experience of that thing (experiencing that something is absent) or to the common practice generally adopted towards it (treating it as absent).[^vyavahara-7] It may well be possible that these semantic distinctions are but an artefact of translation, and the Sanskrit word was fundamentally ambiguous.

[^vyavahara-7]: *anupalambhasya tu a-sad-vyavahāra-yogyatvena saha vyāptiḥ pratyakṣeṇ \^ aiva /* \[tarkabhāṣā 47\] ("The vyāpti between 'non-perception' and 'to be called non-existent' is grasped by the perception \[of things other than the denied object\]." \[Kajiyama 113\]) *sarva evaṃvidho anupalabdho a-sad-**vyavahāra**-viṣaya iti /* \[vādanyāya\] ("Every thing which is of this kind (i.e. which fulfils the condition of apprehensibility) and is not apprehended is the object of the practice of 'non-existence.'" \[Gokhale 25-26\]) ; *yaḥ sad-vyavahāra-viṣaya upalabdhi-lakṣaṇa-prāptaḥ sa upalabhyata eva /* \[nyāyabiṇḍu\] ("Whatsoever is present (as an object of our purposive actions) and is in conditions of perceptibility, is necesarily perceived." \[Stcherbatsky 151\]).

> A passage from the *Tarkābhāṣā* is interesting in this regard. A parallel construction between vyavahāra √kṛ, which indicates a behaviour, and vyavahāra √sādh, which suggest a proposition, and the explication of trividho vyavahāra as including both kayika and vācika vyavahāra suggest either an intentional pun or that vyavahāra was perceived as intrinsically vague and able to express different semantic nuances within a single passage without compromising its coherence: *abhāva**vyavahāras** tu mūḍhaṃ prati **anupalambhena sādhyate** / tathā hikaścinmūḍho rajaḥprabhṛtiṣu sāṅkhyaprasiddheṣu guṇeṣvanupalambhena pravartitābhāvavyavahāro 'pi punaḥ sarvaṃ sarvatrāstīti svasiddhāntābhyāsāt kvā 'pi pradeśādau ghaṭānupalambhe satyapi nābhāvavyavahāraṃ karotīty **anupalambhena** trividho **vyavahāraḥ kāryate** /tatra niḥśaṅkarāmanāgamanalakṣaṇaḥ **kāyiko vyavahāraḥ** / ghaṭo **nāstīti vācikaḥ** / īdṛśa eva **antarjalpākāro mānasikaś** ceti /* (Tarkabhāṣā, 30)[^vyavahara-8]

[^vyavahara-8]: But \[the logical mark of\] non-cognition is aimed at establishing practical activities concerning absence (abhāvavyavahāra) \[in order to convince\] a stupefied person \[of the absence of a certain thing\]. For example, it is well known in the Saṃkhya \[thought\] that the three primordial qualities beginning with rajas are \[permanently\] existent; a certain follower \[of the school\] actually makes ordinary activities concerning absent things owing to their non-cognition; he, however, is so much inculcated in the doctrine of his own school proclaiming the existence of every thing at every place that he confusedly does not now judge the absence \[of ajar\] in one particular place or another even though the jar is not actually perceived. To this man three kinds of convincing activities (vyavahāra) are to be demonstrated by means of non-cognition: the physical activity consists in moving about the place without hesitation; the verbal activity consists in \[the statement\] that there is no jar; the mental activity is the internal thought (antarjalpa) of the same judgment.(Kajiyama, 78-79)

## <font color='indianred'>context</font> {#sec-context}

The word vyavahāra occurs in three main contexts: the context of trade and affairs, the Mahāyana discourse on language and the two truths and in the context of pramāṇa, especially in the discussion of anupalabdhi. Statistically, the first is too infrequent and lexically varied to yield any keywords, while the others are represented by the keywords displayed in the wordcloud below. Notably, statistical analysis of the immediate context of vyavahāra in our corpus leads to a neat distinction between pramāṇa contexts and all the rest (see dendogram tab below), suggesting that vyavhāra is woven in markedly different lexical pattern in the epistemological literature compared to the rest of the corpus.

The statistics used for keyness are Log Likelyhood over 10 and Log Ratio over 2.5. For the sake of readability, only keywords that occur at least 20 times in the lemma's citations are included in the wordcloud and table.

Words in red point to the sense 'language usage'; those in blue to the sense 'common practice/ordinary experience' and words in grey are characteristic of the pramāṇa context, with the darker ones being the most salient in the context of vyavahāra.

The <b>dendogram</b> is based on the <code>cosine similarity of each keyword within the immediate context of vyavahāra</code> (5 words window to the left and right).

## <font color='indianred'>connotation</font> {#sec-connotation}

Vyavahāra has a <code>neutral connotation</code>, as befits the generic character of its core sense of 'common practice'. It retains a mostly neutral connotation even in the sense of verbal practice, contrary to most o words related to the Mahāyāna discourse on language, which tend to acquire a negative semantic prosody in sūtras. This is because vyavahāra is seen mostly as a necessary, if imperfect, bridge towards <i>paramārtha</i>, rather than as a source of delusion. The sense of mundane affairs occurs in a positive prosody in narrative literature, but, predictably, assumes a negative tinge in pratimokṣa contexts, where dealing with money is forbidden.

<b>semantic prosody (sem.pros) here refers to whether a lemma acquires a positive or negative overtone in context.</b> Generally the semantic prosody associated to a word emerges from a repeated pattern of use. For example we can say that 'set in' has a negative connotation in English because it is systematically associated with words that possess a negative connotation (Louw 1993). For a pattern to emerge, we need to consider many individual instances. To this end in this project we treat semantic prosody slightly differently and we annotate it in each citation as a property of each instantiation of a lemma in context.

We use a fourfold typology for semantic prosody: <code>positive</code>, <code>negative</code>, <code>neutral</code> and <code>neutral-nagative</code>. We annotate a lemma as having negative semantic prosody when the concept expressed by the lemma is clearly depicted as negative , e.g. the lemma vikalpa in the phrase <i>vikalpasaṃsārāvahāka</i> (vikalpa is the source of saṃsāra).

Conversely, we annotate semantic prosody as positive if the concept expressed by a lemma is described as positive, or leading to something good etc. In cases where the lemma is negated (e.g. na vikalpayati) or is modified by an adjective with a negative connotation which suggests that some aspects of the concept expressed by the lemma are negative ( but not the concept tout-court, e.g. <i>akuśala-vikalpa</i>), we annotate the semantic prosody as being neutral-negative.

Given the rarity of positive semantic prosody in the vocabulary explored in the Visual Dictionary and Thesaurus of Buddhist Sanskrit we categorize all positive occurrences as pos, even when they would better lend themselves to neu.pos, for analogy with neu.neg above.
