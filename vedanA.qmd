### <font color='indianred'>overview</font> {#sec-overview}

*Vedanā* belongs to the semantic domain of **`Physical sensation`**, where it presents a limited range of semantic applications. It core meaning can be summarized as `feeling/sensation`, the physical response that arises when the internal sense organs come into contact with external sensory objects.[^vedana-1] *Vedanā* can also denote specifically `pain`, both physical and emotional, which is a narrower experiential category within the sense `feeling/sensation`.[^vedana-2] Finally, a terminological application of its core meaning is instantiatied in the specialized sense `one of the 5 skandhas`, considered a fundamental mental factor central to perception and consciousness.[^vedana-3]

    "5. That which is the coincidence of visual form, consciousness, and the eye: That is sensual perception; and from perception, sensation begins to function."

[^vedana-2]: śāmyantu **vedanās** tīvrā nārakāṇāṃ bhayāni ca / durgatibhyo vimucyantāṃ sarva-durgati-vāsinaḥ // *bodhicaryāvatāra* 10.15\
    "Let them quiet the intense agonies and fears of hell. May those dwelling in misfortune be released from their misfortunes."

[^vedana-3]: evam eva mahā-rāja rūpa-**vedanā**-saṃjñā-saṃskāra-vijñanāṃ svabhāvo n \^ābhūn na bhaviṣyati na c \^aitarhi vidyate ity ādi // *śikṣāsamuccaya* 256\
    "In just the same way, Your Majesty, the intrinsic nature of form, feeling, conceptions, conditioning and consciousness was not, will not be, and does not exist now."

The most prominent is the **skandha enumeration** "*rūpa-vedanā-saṃjñā-saṃskāra-vijñāna*", which appears consistently across different text-types.[^vedana-4] Another important pattern is **"duḥkhā vedanā"** (painful sensation), often in contexts describing suffering or its cessation.[^vedana-5]

[^vedana-4]: evam eva mahā-rāja rūpa-**vedanā**-saṃjñā-saṃskāra-vijñanāṃ svabhāvo n \^ābhūn na bhaviṣyati na c \^aitarhi vidyate ity ādi // *śikṣāsamuccaya* 256\

The **causal chain expression** "sparśa-pratyayā vedanā vedanā-pratyayā tṛṣṇā" (sensation conditioned by contact, craving conditioned by sensation) appears in multiple texts, representing the standard formulation of the links of dependent origination.[^vedana-6] Additionally, **"vedanāsu vedanā-smṛty-upasthāna"** (mindfulness of sensations in sensations) represents the specialised use in meditation contexts.[^vedana-7]

### <font color='indianred'>connotation</font> {#sec-connotation}

Notably, in our annotated data *vedanā*'s semantic prosody is never positive. It is mostly neutral, especially when *vedanā* functions as a technical philosophical term, particularly in skandha enumerations, as in "rūpaṃ vedanā saṃjñā saṃskārā vijñānam" \[Aṣṭasāhasrikā\].

Negative prosody dominates when *vedanā* denotes painful or unpleasant experiences, exemplified in passages like "pragāḍha-duḥkha-vedan-ābhyāhato murcchitas tiṣṭhati" from the Suvarṇavarṇāvadāna. Neutral-negative prosody appears in contexts where *vedanā* is discussed as a phenomenon to be transcended, reflecting Buddhism's broader approach to experiential categories.
