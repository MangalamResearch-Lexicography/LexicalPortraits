### <font color='indianred'>overview</font> {#sec-overview}

*adhimukti* belongs mainly to the domain of **`Belief`**, where it expresses three closely related senses. The most prominent is `conviction`, intended as steadfast acceptance of the Buddhis doctrine, which enables a practitioner, typically a bodhisattva, to hold fast to faith and advance on the path to liberation.[^adhimukti-1] This sense finds a specialized application in the sense `power of conviction`, which refers to the capacity of effecting miraculous changes in the world merely by strongly believing in them,[^adhimukti-2] or to the mastery of resolution as one of the ten strengths of a Bodhisattva.[^adhimukti-3] In this same vein, the sense `resolution/determination` is understood as a mental state of reolve to hold on to a teaching or meditative object.[^adhimukti-4] This brings adhimukti closer to the demain of `Thought`, where it expresses the meaning of `attentiveness`.

[^adhimukti-1]: mahāyāna-parama-dharm-**\^ādhimukti**-bhāvanāyā hi tathāgato atyanta-śubha-dharma-dhātu-paramat-\^ādhigamād dharma-dhātu-paramaḥ saṃvṛttaḥ / *ratnagotravibhāga* 32\
    "Indeed, the Tathāgata, through the practice of faith in the highest Doctrine of the Great Vehicle, has attained the highest state of the Absolute Essence which is the ultimate purity, hence he has become the highest Absolute Essence." \[Takasaki 213\]

[^adhimukti-2]: pratigṛhya c \^aikaṃ pātram adhitiṣṭhati sma **adhimukti**-balena / *lalitavistara* 279\
    "When he had accepted it, he transformed all four alms bowls into one through the power of his wish, …" \[Dahl et al. & 84000: Translating the Words of the Buddha 24.108\]

[^adhimukti-3]: āyur-vaśitā citta-vaśitā pariṣkāra-vaśitā dharma-vaśitā ṛddhi-vaśitā janma-vaśitā **adhimukti**-vaśitā praṇidhāna-vaśitā karma-vaśitā jñāna-vaśitā c \^eti // *dharmasaṃgraha* 333\
    "There are ten masteries of the Bodhisattvas, {1} mastery of life, {2} mastery of mind, {3} mastery of discipline, {4} mastery of dharma, {5} mastery of spiritual power, {6} mastery of birth, {7} mastery of resolution, {8} mastery of aspiration, {9} mastery of deeds, {10} and mastery of knowledge." \[Bhikkhu 55-6\]

[^adhimukti-4]: artha-pratisaṃvidā catur-aśīti-sattva-carita-sahasrāṇāṃ yath \^āśayaṃ yath \^endriyaṃ yath **\^ādhimukti**-vibhaktitas tathāgata-ghoṣaṃ prajānati / *daśabhūmikasūtra* 52\
    "By the analytical knowledge of meaning he understands the voice of Tathāgata according to the intentions, the faculties and the distinctions of resolute beliefs in eighty-four thousand ways of conduct of living beings." \[Honda 248\]

The distribution across Buddhist traditions reveals interesting patterns. Yogācāra texts show a preference for the "conviction" sense, as exemplified in the *Bodhisattvabhūmi*: "sā punar adhimuktir dvābhyāṃ kāraṇābhyāṃ su-sanniviṣṭā bhavati" (that conviction becomes well-established through two causes). The "Resolution/determination" sense appears more frequently in foundational sūtra literature, particularly in Prajñāpāramitā texts, where it often denotes spiritual resolve or determination toward enlightenment.
