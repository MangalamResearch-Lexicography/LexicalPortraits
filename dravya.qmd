### <font color='indianred'>overview</font> {#sec-overview}

While fairly polysemic, the semantic spectrum of *dravya* lies entirely within the domain of `Existence`, where it variously conveys the notion of substance, covering highly abstract philosophical instances of this concept, down to very concrete applications.

In philosophical discourse, such substance takes the form of a `ontologically real entity`, understood as the substratum underlying reality and experience, usually with an emphasis on its impermanence and dependent origination.[^dravya-1] With a more concrete denotation, *dravya* refers to `substance` as the fundamental material or essence out of which things are made.[^dravya-2] A closely related meaning is the broader, and even more concrete sense of `object`, typically referring to the objects of the senses, or the objects of experience.[^dravya-3] Finally, at the most concrete end of *dravya*'s semantic spectrum lie the senses of "**good/possession**"[^dravya-4] and "**medication/ointment**".[^dravya-5]

    "5.79 \[Things\] do not arise or cease, are not things, and are empty, because they do not arise from themselves and because they are not substantially real." \[Eckel 279\]

[^dravya-2]: tatra na tāvat guṇ-\^ādayaḥ **dravya**-niṣedhen \^aiva teṣāṃ niṣedhāt / *tarkabhāṣā_mokṣākaragupta* 64\
    "Of these, neither quality nor the others \[i.e. karman, sāmānya, and viśeṣa\] are \[the external reality\], since their existence is negated through the negation of the substance \[which forms their substratum\]." \[Kajiyama 141\]

    "If one entity as a sense-object for the eye, with no separations, and no severalness, were constructed, the one couldn’t arrive at anything gradually on the Earth: that is, there could be no act of going." \[Anacker 170\]

    "When he does not take anything that belongs to others, unless it is given to him, whether that is in one's house or lying on the way, possesses the second characteristic of a Brāhmaṇa." \[Mukhopadyaya 21\]

#### <font color='indianred'>distribution in our sample</font> {#sec-frequency}

In our sample of annotated sentences, *dravya*'s distribution across textual traditions shows a clear concentration in **pramāṇa** literature, followed by **yogācāra**, **madhyamaka** sources.

### <font color='indianred'>frequency & register </font>

*Dravya* is a high-frequency word in our corpus, with its highest normalized frequency in **śāstra** literature, confirming our annonated data's representation of the term's primary textual habitat.

The **commentarial** period exhibits the highest frequency, followed by **classical** texts, suggesting that this term acquired increasing importance with the evolution of Buddhist philosophy.

**Sūtra** literature shows lower frequency despite containing some discussions of the term.[^dravya-6]

[^dravya-6]: *prajñapti-satyato hy ātmā **dravya** san na hi vidyate / skandhānāṃ skandhatā tadvat prajñaptyā na tu **dravyataḥ*** // \[*laṅkāvatārasūtra,* 62\]\
    "27. An ego-soul is a truth belonging to thought-construction, in which there is no real reality; the self-nature of the Skandhas is also a thought-construction, as there is no reality in it." \[Suzuki, 132\]

This distributional pattern indicates that dravya in Buddhist literature is used mostly in a specialized, philosophical sense. Still, the non negligible amount of occurrences in narrative material (\~300 between literary and avadāna texts), couple with the every-day senses of possessions and medication, are a reminder that this was a general language word as well as a philosophical term.

### <font color='indianred'>context</font> {#sec-context}

Several collocational patterns featuring *dravya* are noteworthy. The compound *dravya-sat* (substantially existent) appears often in contexts examining the ontological status of phenomena, where it is typically contrasted with *prajñapti-sat*.[^dravya-7] The negated form *a-dravya* (non-substantial) is frequent, particularly in madhyamaka literature, where discussions of the absence of inherent existence are prominent.[^dravya-8] The adverbial form **dravyataḥ** (substantially/in terms of substance) appears frequently in ontological discussions, again often contrasted with *prajñapti*, or conventional existence.[^dravya-9]

[^dravya-7]: na ca punaḥ kula-putrasya vā kula-duhitur vā sarva-kāl-\^āstitāñ ca **dravya**-satāṃ svabhāva-pariniṣpattiñ ca prajñapti-satāṃ paśyato nirvid-virāgo vimuktiś ca yujyate / *bodhisattvabhūmi* 190\
    "It is also unreasonable that a son of good family or a daughter of good family who believes that a substantively real form of existence is one that remains in existence at all times or \[who believes\] that a nominal form of existence is one that exists absolutely in that it possesses a \[real\] essential nature, could \[develop\] dissatisfaction and detachment, and \[attain\] liberation." \[Engle 458-9\]

[^dravya-8]: sad-bhūten ātmanā jāter an-utpann-\^ā-niruddhatā / a-vastutv-ā-svabhāvatve tath \^āpy a-**dravya**-sattvataḥ // 5—79 // *madhyamakahṛdayakārikā* 5.78\
    "5.79 \[Things\] do not arise or cease, are not things, and are empty, because they do not arise from themselves and because they are not substantially real." \[Eckel 279\]

[^dravya-9]: prajñapty astitayā vācyaḥ pudgalo **dravyato** na tu / n opalambhād viparyāsāt saṃkleśāt kliṣṭa-hetutaḥ // 18—92 // *mahāyānasūtrālaṃkāra* 154\
    "93. The person is identifiable as conventionally existent and not substantial; since it is not perceived, is a distortion, is addictive, and is from an addicted cause." \[Thurman 285\]

### <font color='indianred'>connotation</font> {#sec-connotation}

Semantic prosody analysis reveals that *dravya* is used predominantly with `neutral` tones, with some notable **negative** coloring and virtually no **positive** usage attested in our annotated sentences.

The `neutral` usage typically occurs in technical philosophical discussions, such as in the *Abhidharmakośabhāṣya*: "yāvanti hi saṃyoga-**dravyāṇi** tavanti visaṃyoga-**dravyāṇi**",[^dravya-10] where the term functions as a technical philosophical category without evaluative connotation.

[^dravya-10]: "There are as many objects of combination as there are objects of dissociation." \[Pruden\]

The `negative` prosody frequently appears in contexts discussing the ontological status of phenomena, particularly in passages that deny substantial existence. For example, the *Laṅkāvatārasūtra* states "*prajñapti-satyato hy ātmā **dravya** san na hi vidyate*",[^dravya-11] where *dravya* carries negative implications regarding ultimate reality.

[^dravya-11]: "27. An ego-soul is a truth belonging to thought-construction, in which there is no real reality; …" \[Suzuki 132\]
